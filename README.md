This is a stats/probability based resource management game. You control a starship that goes to different star systems. Random events happen on your trips ranging from encountering hostile ships to finding resources. You have to careful select how many resources you want to commit to your ship in these cases, do you want to use 100% of your engine's power or can you go with reduced power so you can boost your shields to 100%. Tactical thinking is required to use the least amount of energy possible to manage your ship's finite resources. You can buy more energy at each location, with differing costs. Systems further out from Earth have higher costs due to their frontier nature. However, the further out from Earth you are, the more resources you are likely to find.

Planned features:

Upgradeable ship statistics, health, energy, shields, etc. purchased with credits
More random events, more factors influencing outcomes of these events
More sound effects
