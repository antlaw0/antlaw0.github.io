      <h1>Welcome to ANTLAW GAMES!</h1>
      <br>
	  <p>
	  This is where I'm planning to put all the games and other creative works of mine. I started on itch.io so have links to games I have there. None of my games are entirely complete (its that whole crazy artist thing) but some are further along than others. Time, life, and my abundant coffee supply permitting, I plan to add to this portfolio and update things regularly. Without furtherr ado, here's what I have so far:

	<p>
	This is the one that started it all. I had been tinkering with game development for a few years before I finally gave myself a deadline to publish my first game. This was the result. Part top-down shooter, part roguelike, here it is! It is better if you download it rather than play it in browser. I added the browser version years later when I got GameMaker Studio so it isn't optimized for html5 but hey, at least I managed to do it.
	This game is the first of a planned trilogy of games in the Omega Protocol universe. This game actually takes place at the end of the three games and the second comes before this one while the third one (when it comes out) will be the first. I don't know how many creative works do this and maybe there is a reason there are not more stories like this, but I like this form of non-linear naritive. Plus I thought it would be fun to have my own little universe for world-building and such.

	<p>
	And now for RoboCore! This game is inspired by the Armored Core series of which I've been a long-time fan. Giant customizable fighting robots? What could be better? There are only currently a handful of missions but I will hopefully add more at some point. Also may contain bugs.

	<a href="https://ai-game-azzk.onrender.com/">The AI Cooking Game</a>
    <p>This is a more recent addition to my collection. This is a full-stack browser-based game. It uses AI to make a text-only cooking simulator. Basically, it is like a Dungeon Master in a game of Dungeons and Dragons where you type what you want to do and the AI tells you the outcome. You start with nothing but a street-side food cart and a hotplate and cook breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert each day to earn money based off your cooking knowledge and technique. The AI gives you a score out of 10 which determines how much money you earn. Money is used at the Cooking Emporium to buy more ingredients and cooking supplies and eventually better cooking venues such as a food truck and restaurant. The key is how much description about what and how you cook that determines your success so the better cooks out there will obviously do better at this game. Did I mention it is completely screen reader accessible?

	<a href="https://antlaw0.github.io/TheBrailleGame/"> The Braille Game</a>
	<p> Following my totally original naming style, we have The Braille Game. This is a static web app that uses JavaScript to simulate keys on a Braille keyboard using the home row keys. The more letters you can type correctly in a minute, the higher score you get. The game uses the JavaScript's built-in text to speech API to speak the dots or letters that appear on the screen. I find the TTS API immensely useful for making accessible apps and games <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API">(link to MDN Web Docs for the JavaScript TTS API)</a>.

	The whole of Gotham City is a chessboard. There are pons, bishops, kings and queens. And only one dark knight to stop them all from taking over the whole city. You make the moves, you choose your targets, you wage war against those who seek to claim Gotham City for their own.
